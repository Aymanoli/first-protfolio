        <h2>Most Popular Programming Language</h2>
        <div class="six">
            <div class="seven">
                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p>Number of jobs: 19,000
           
                Average annual salary: $120,000
                
                Benefits: Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits, and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and C++. In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. “You can cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.” It is a popular programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="seven">
                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Number of jobs: 24,000 Average annual salary: $118,000
                Benefits: JavaScript is the most popular programming language for building interactive websites; “virtually everyone is using it,” Gorton says. When combined with Node.js, programmers can use JavaScript to produce web content on the server before a page is sent to the browser, which can be used to build games and communication applications that run directly in the browser. A wide variety of add-ons extend the functionality of JavaScript as well. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="seven">
                <h2>Java</h2>
                <p>Number of jobs: 29,000

                    Average annual salary: $104,000
                    
                    Benefits: Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the development of client-server applications, which are used by large businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely coupled programming language, meaning that an application written in Java can run on any platform that supports Java. As a result, Java is described as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language.</p>

                <div class="seven">
                <h2>C++</h2>
                <p>Number of jobs: 9,000

                Average annual salary: $97,000
                
                Benefits: C++ is an extension of C that works well for programming the systems that run applications, as opposed to the applications themselves. C++ also works well for multi-device and multi-platform systems. Over time, programmers have written a large set of libraries and compilers for C++. Being able to use these utilities effectively is just as important to understanding a programming language as writing code, Gorton says.</p>
